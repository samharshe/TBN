not-very-successful (so far) efforts to predict NBA games with machine learning.

neural networks were always the wrong tools. my best model so far predicts winners with 69% accuracy, only marginally better than Las Vegas. in case that sounds good, note that taking any reasonably insightful all-in-one team stat, giving the home team a 10%-ish boost, and picking the team with the higher final value correctly predicts the winner roughly 65% of the time. 

I am going to be less lazy with preprocessing now—this should always have been the heart of the project—and fiddle around with classical stats and less trendy ML techniques.
