I would like you to write a web scraper for the 2015-16 NBA season through the 2023-24 NBA season. You should save game-by-game statistics from both players and teams. 

You should do this by iterating through each date of each season, encoding the date, season type, and statistic type into the URL, as in "https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced?Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular+Season&DateFrom=10%2F27%2F2015&DateTo=10%2F27%2F2015". You should collect both team and player statistics, and save each game's statistics as one row in a CSV file corresponding to a particular player or a particular team. Thus, the file structure should be as follows:
DATA
--- TEAM
------ ATLANTA HAWKS.csv
------ BOSTON CELTICS.csv
------ ...
--- PLAYER
------ A.J. GREEN.csv
------ A.J. HAMMONS.csv
------ ...

I would like the following data items for each team:
Under General/Advanced, I would like PACE and PIE.
Under Tracking/Passing, I would like PASSES MADE. This should be saved as PASSES_MADE.
Under Tracking/Touches, I would like AVG SEC PER TOUCH. This should be saved as SEC_TOUCH.
Under Tracking/Rebounding, I would like ADJUSTED REB CHANCE %. This should be saved as ADJ_REB_CHANCE_%.
Under Tracking/Offensive Rebounding, I would like ADJUSTED REB CHANCE %. This should be saved as ADJ_OFF_REB_CHANCE_%.
Under Tracking/Defensive Rebounding, I would like ADJUSTED REB CHANCE %. This should be saved as ADJ_DEF_REB_CHANCE_%.
Under Tracking/Speed and Distance, I would like AVG SPEED OFF. This should be saved as AVG_SPEED_OFF.
Under Shooting/Distance Range==By Zone, I would like FGM and FGA from all zones other than LEFT CORNER 3 and RIGHT CORNER 3. In other words, I would like FGM and FGA from RESTRICTED AREA,	IN THE PAINT (NON-RA), MID-RANGE, CORNER 3, and ABOVE THE BREAK 3. These should be saved as FGM_RA, FGA_RA, FGM_PAINT, FGA_PAINT, FGM_MID-RANGE, FGA_MID-RANGE, FGM_CORNER, FGA_CORNER, FGM_AB, FGA_AB. Note that this probably must be dealt with differently because of the multi-level headers on the webpage.
Under Hustle, I would like DEFLECTIONS and SCREEN ASSISTS PTS. These should be saved as DEFLECTIONS and SCREEN_AST_PTS.
Under Tracking/Shooting Efficiency, I would like DRIVE PTS, C&S PTS, PULL UP PTS, PAINT TOUCH PTS, POST TOUCH PTS, ELBOW TOUCH PTS. These should be saved as DRIVE_PTS, C&S_PTS, PULL_UP_PTS, PAINT_TOUCH_PTS, POST_TOUCH_PTS, and ELBOW_TOUCH_PTS.

I would like all of the above data items for each team. I would also like:
Under Defense Dashboard/2 Pointers, I would like FREQ%, DFGM, DFGA, and FG%. These should be saved as OPP_2PT_FREQ_%, OPP_2PT_DFGM, OPP_2PT_DFGA, and OPP_2PT_FG_%.
Under Defense Dashboard/3 Pointers, I would like FREQ%, DFGM, DFGA, and FG%. These should be saved as OPP_3PT_FREQ_%, OPP_3PT_DFGM, OPP_3PT_DFGA, and OPP_3PT_FG_%.

Thus, the columns in each team's CSV file should be:
DATE, SEASON, GAME_TYPE, PACE, PIE, PASSES_MADE, SEC_TOUCH, ADJ_REB_CHANCE_%, ADJ_OFF_REB_CHANCE_%, ADJ_DEF_REB_CHANCE_%, AVG_SPEED_OFF, FGM_RA, FGA_RA, FGM_PAINT, FGA_PAINT, FGM_MID-RANGE, FGA_MID-RANGE, FGM_CORNER, FGA_CORNER, FGM_AB, FGA_AB, DEFLECTIONS, SCREEN_AST_PTS, DRIVE_PTS, C&S_PTS, PULL_UP_PTS, PAINT_TOUCH_PTS, POST_TOUCH_PTS, ELBOW_TOUCH_PTS.

The columns in each player's CSV file should be:
DATE, SEASON, GAME_TYPE, PACE, PIE, PASSES_MADE, SEC_TOUCH, ADJ_REB_CHANCE_%, ADJ_OFF_REB_CHANCE_%, ADJ_DEF_REB_CHANCE_%, AVG_SPEED_OFF, FGM_RA, FGA_RA, FGM_PAINT, FGA_PAINT, FGM_MID-RANGE, FGA_MID-RANGE, FGM_CORNER, FGA_CORNER, FGM_AB, FGA_AB, DEFLECTIONS, SCREEN_AST_PTS, DRIVE_PTS, C&S_PTS, PULL_UP_PTS, PAINT_TOUCH_PTS, POST_TOUCH_PTS, ELBOW_TOUCH_PTS, OPP_2PT_FREQ_%, OPP_2PT_DFGM, OPP_2PT_DFGA, OPP_2PT_FG_%, OPP_3PT_FREQ_%, OPP_3PT_DFGM, OPP_3PT_DFGA, OPP_3PT_FG_%.
